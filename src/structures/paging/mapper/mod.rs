    ///
    /// - Aliasing of `&mut` references, i.e. two `&mut` references that point to
    ///   the same physical address. This is undefined behavior in Rust.
    ///     - This can be ensured by mapping each page to an individual physical
    ///       frame that is not mapped anywhere else.
    /// - Creating uninitalized or invalid values: Rust requires that all values
    ///   have a correct memory layout. For example, a `bool` must be either a 0
    ///   or a 1 in memory, but not a 3 or 4. An exception is the `MaybeUninit`
    ///   wrapper type, which abstracts over possibly uninitialized memory.
    ///     - This is only a problem when re-mapping pages to different physical
    ///       frames. Mapping a page that is not in use yet is fine.
